    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that <b>delights the senses</b> with its
      layers of flavor and texture. At its heart lies sheets of pasta, perfectly
      cooked to achieve a tender yet firm bite. Between these layers, a rich
      blend of savory ground meat—often beef or sausage—mingles with a tangy
      tomato sauce infused with aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. Creamy
      ricotta cheese adds a luscious element, while a generous sprinkling of
      mozzarella melts beautifully on top, creating a golden, bubbly crust that
      beckons from the oven.

    <p>
      This hearty dish is not just a meal; it’s a celebration of comfort and
      warmth, often shared at family gatherings or special occasions. Each slice
      reveals a harmonious interplay of ingredients, where the sweetness of the
      tomato sauce meets the richness of the cheese, complemented by the robust
      flavor of the meat. Served hot with a side of garlic bread and a fresh
      salad, lasagna embodies the spirit of Italian home cooking—nourishing,
      satisfying, and <b>utterly irresistible</b>.
