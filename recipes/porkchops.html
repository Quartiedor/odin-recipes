      <h2>Recipe description</h2>
      <p>
        Oven-Fried Pork Chops are a
        <strong
          >deliciously crispy and flavorful alternative to traditional
          frying</strong
        >
        , offering a healthier take on a classic comfort food. The recipe begins
        with thick-cut pork chops that are seasoned to perfection with a blend
        of spices, including garlic powder, paprika, and a hint of cayenne for a
        subtle kick. Each chop is then coated in a mixture of breadcrumbs and
        panko, which ensures an <em>extra crunchy texture when baked</em>. This
        method locks in the juices, keeping the meat tender and moist while
        delivering that satisfying crunch that makes every bite irresistible.
