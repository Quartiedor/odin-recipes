    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Macaroni and cheese is a beloved comfort food that brings a sense of
      nostalgia with every creamy, cheesy bite. This classic dish features al
      dente macaroni pasta enveloped in a velvety cheese sauce, typically made
      from a blend of sharp cheddar, creamy Gruyère, and sometimes a hint of
      tangy Parmesan. The sauce, thick and luscious, clings to each piece of
      pasta, creating a satisfying, indulgent experience. Topped with a crunchy
      breadcrumb layer, it’s baked to perfection, achieving a golden-brown crust
      that contrasts delightfully with the gooey interior.

      jalapeños for an extra kick. Whether enjoyed at a family gathering, a cozy
      night in, or as a nostalgic treat, macaroni and cheese is a dish that
      transcends generations, offering comfort and joy with each delicious
      spoonful.
